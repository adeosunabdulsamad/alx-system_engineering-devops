# Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration and setup instructions for a simple web infrastructure that hosts the website reachable via www.foobar.com. The infrastructure consists of a single server running Nginx as the web server, serving dynamic content through an application server, and storing data in a MySQL database.

## Components

1. **Server**: A single server hosting the website files, application server, and MySQL database.

2. **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content as well as routes dynamic requests to the application server.

3. **Application Server**: Hosts the application code base and processes dynamic requests, interacting with the MySQL database to generate dynamic content.

4. **Database (MySQL)**: Stores and manages the website's data, including user information, content, and settings.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Configure the server by following the instructions in the `server-setup.md` file.

3. Install and configure Nginx as the web server by following the instructions in the `nginx-setup.md` file.

4. Set up the application server and deploy your application code base according to your specific requirements.

5. Install and configure MySQL as the database server by following the instructions in the `mysql-setup.md` file.

6. Point the domain name www.foobar.com to your server's IP address using DNS records.

7. Start the services (Nginx, application server, MySQL) on your server.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, users can access the website by entering www.foobar.com into their web browsers.

## Issues and Limitations

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: The infrastructure has a single server, which represents a single point of failure. Consider implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms to mitigate this risk.

2. **Downtime During Maintenance**: During maintenance activities, such as deploying new code or updates, the web server may need to be restarted, causing downtime for the website.

3. **Scalability Limitations**: With only one server, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a large volume of incoming traffic. Consider implementing load balancing and scaling strategies to address scalability concerns.
